List of git-hooks to use with Git

This repo contains a list of my personalized git hooks I use for several projects. Feel free to use them.

I based these git hooks from https://github.com/githubbrowser/Pre-commit-hooks so that I can have multiple hooks per action and maintain them on their own script page.


Installation
============

Just add the following files to your /.git/hooks/ directory.

 * canonicalize_filename.sh
 * pre-commit
 * pre-commit-console-log
 * pre-commit-nonascii
 * pre-commit-prevent-branches
 * pre-push
 * pre-push-prevent-branches
